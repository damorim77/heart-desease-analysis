## Problem
To develop a machine learning classification model that could predict the presence of heart desease on patients.

## Steps to solve
* Exploratory analyisis
  * Univariate analyisis: central tendency measures, dispersion tendency measures, data distribution analysis, outlier detection
  * Bivariate analysis: measures of association/correlation between features and target variable
* Statistical tests: normality and independence of variables
* Experiments: 
  * testing several combinations of variables and ML classification algorithms measuring their performances (Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity) to select a few outstanding ones
  * testing the best performing models on 100 resamples and measuring their overall performance
  * selecting the best performing one
  * tuning the model

## Notes
* Developed in R using RStudio
* Excel spreadsheets contains outputs of analyis
